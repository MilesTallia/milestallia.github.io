                        Worked with Unity to create a miniature “collecting” game where the player runs around collecting resources. <br><br>
                        Personally worked on player movement, spawning/despawning entities, and collisions.<br><br>
                        Use WASD or arrows to move and 1&2 for different attacks.

                        Used Unity to build a classic “Shoot 'em Up” style game where you fight a continuously growing number of ships. <br><br>
                        Created all the sprites using cloud-based vector graphic software. <br><br>
                        Applied object-oriented programming practices for the use of variable enemy ships. <br><br>
                        Thoroughly playtested the game, removing bugs and scaling difficulty as required.<br><br>
                        Use WASD or arrows to move and Spacebar to shoot.
