                Oh water-fountain, how fair you are in the light morning air<br>
                How your sweet liquid graces my lips<br>
                The way of the water transcends the way of the people<br>
                The iceberg that is you composer reimagines my world<br>
            </p>
            <p class="poemRight">
                The duplicity of your existence<br>
                The form you take in my mind<br>
                Compared with the validity of your essence<br>
                You may be a stranger, but you are kind<br>
            </p>
            <p class="poemLeft">
                When I dream it is only of you<br>
                In these dreams you are more than yourself yes<br>
                But it is not what you aren't that I dream<br>
                It is what you can bring that I dream<br>
            </p>
            <p class="poemRight">
                For you I would travel any distance<br>
                And when I go so far I am glad to find<br>
                What but an extraordinary assistance<br>
                And how it gets us intertwined<br>
            </p>
            <p class="poemLeft">
                When I dream it is only of you<br>
                In these dreams you are more than yourself yes<br>
                But it is not what you aren't that I dream<br>
                It is what you can bring that I dream<br>    
            </p>
            <p class="poemRight">
                The beauty of your creation astounds us all<br>
                I cannot but fear that if you fall<br>
                The people may be lost in the tides of shadow<br>
                And that you may have just received your last blow<br>
            </p>
